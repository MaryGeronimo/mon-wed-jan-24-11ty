In the second session with The Coder's Guild, we looked at how to improve Accessibility, something I had previously looked into with Code First Girls. 

<h1>Semantic HTML and Accessibility with The Coder's Guild</h1>

Previously, when I looked into accessibility, I learned about providing sufficient colour contrast and avoiding small fonts. This session delved deeper into accessibility, looking at the use of alt text for images, ARIA, and how to run a Lighthouse report to analyse the accessibility of the website. 

I found this session helpful and interesting and feel like the Lighthouse report is an invaluable tool in ensuring that you are making your website as accessible as you can. In highlighting any areas for improvement, and advising on how to make those necessary changes, the Lighthouse report enables coders to increase the accessibility of their websites.

As well as conducting a Lighthouse report, we were also tasked with replicating a table in HTML, styling it with CSS (our Semantic HTML Challenge). This was a difficult task which I initially struggled with but managed to get through and it was so satisfying when I could see it looking more and more like the original table we were tasked to recreate. So far, this is my favourite takeaway task from The Coder's Guild.
