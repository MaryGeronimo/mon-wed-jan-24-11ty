I have just begun the next step on my journey into coding and have started a course with The Coder's Guild. Following our introductory session, we first delved into basics of HTML and CSS. 

<h1>Coder's Guild - HTML and CSS</h1>

As Code First Girls taught me HTML and CSS I was fairly confident with this first session but was stuck when it came to applying my knowledge and completing the task of creating a portfolio homepage. 

I didn't know where to start and was overwhelmed and overthinking but, once I'd started, it was enjoyable to see what I could create with the little experience I had. 

The requirements of the portfolio homepage were to create a page with a header, footer, a hero section, a list of skills and numerous other things. I was able to use my existing knowledge of bootstrap to help me with the header and footer and managed to add some styling to the page too.
