<h1>Bootstrap in The Coder's Guild</h1>

In this latest session with The Coder's Guild, we learned about the use of bootstrap and how it can be utilised alongside HTML and CSS to create more of a finished look to our websites. I had used bootstrap previously, so it was a useful refresher and, during the session, I was able to explore bootstrap in greater detail. 

Our takeaway task was to create a website from scratch using bootstrap to add elements such as an accordion, a carousel, etc. We were tasked to design a website about a business we cared about so I chose my brother's artwork. He hadn't actually tried to sell any of his art so this was also to encourage him to believe in his artistic abilities.
