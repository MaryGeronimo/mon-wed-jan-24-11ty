Prior to starting the Crucial Skills for Software Developers course at the Coder's Guild, I had completed an Introduction to Web Development course with Code First Girls. 

Before learning with Code First Girls, I'd made attempts at teaching myself how to code but struggled without a clear direction. I didn't really know where to start but loved the idea of coding and of being able to see the immediate results of my problem solving. I initially looked at studying with the Northcoders but felt that I would not manage to do so while working full time. I soon found Code First Girls and was able to complete a short kickstarter course with them.

At Code First Girls, I developed my passion for coding (mainly in CSS). I learned the basics of HTML and CSS while dabbling in JavaScript. For the main project with Code First Girls, I worked in a team to create a website on our chosen theme; cats in media. 

<h1>Code First Girls - Nine Lives</h1>

With our group deciding to create a trivia website on cats in media, we were able to have a lot of fun while learning and working together. We shared responsibilities, helping eachother whenever we came across problems. I focused mainly on the styling of the website and the content with my peer focusing on a quiz, as I had not yet gained confidence in using JavaScript. 

In talking with eachother about the issues we faced, we were able to help one another and learn from these problems too, developing my knowledge of coding and, specifically, JavaScript. 

We also delivered a presentation on our website; we talked through how we planned it initially, how we shared responsibilities, and how we overcome the obstacles we faced. 

Check out the final product of our <a href="https://marygeronimo.github.io/NineLivesCFG/index.html" target=_blank>Nine Lives</a> website here!

Our team of three were each recognised as a 'Highly Commended Candidate' for the hard work we put in to create our Nine Lives website and Code First Girls definitely set me up with a love of coding.
