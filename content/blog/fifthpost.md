<h1>Creating a HTML form, and adding it to our static site. </h1>

In this session we looked at how forms can be utilised on various websites and discussed the importance of safely collecting data, in line with GDPR. 

We also explored how to collect the data from our static sites and were tasked with doing so as our takeaway task. This session was a welcome respite from other heavy sessions we had been doing (this is not actually session 5, I've been tired since that hard hitting one).

For our takeaway task, we were asked to create a HTML form, stylise it with bootstrap and CSS and then to test the form on our static site and to test the data collected from it. 

Here is the form, please complete it so I can carry out the rest of the task ðŸ˜‰


    <h2>The Form</h2>
    <form action="#">
      <legend>
        <label for="name">Username:</label><br/>
